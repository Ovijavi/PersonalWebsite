									<h2>Journal Entry Website</h2>
									<h5>June 2021</h5>
									<p>The purpose of the journal entry website was to help the user ogranize items that can either be tasks, events or notes on a planner/calendar. 
										They could choose from different pages to add and display different items on their agenda. The rapid log allows the user to quickly add 
										items for the current day. The monthly log allows the user to view and add all items for the given month. Daily logs allow the user to 
										view a specific day of the month. Future logs give the user the ability to add items months in advance. Custom logs are for items that
										 are not time based.

									<p>Website was for a project-based Software Engineering course where I worked on a team of ten programmers to design a website. We incorporated
										agile methodologies to oganize meetings and assign tasks each week. We worked on Virtual Studio to write different JavaScript, CSS and HTML files.
										We also used GitHub for version control on the website. This project gave me exposure to what the professional enviorment of software Engineering
										is like.

									<h2>Bike Share Case Study</h2>
									<h5>August 2023</h5>
									<p>Bike Share is a bike rental company that allows users to pay money in order to rent bikes from stations all around the city. Bike Share offers a
										membership program that allows users to pay an annual fee in order to use their bikes throughout the year. The purpose of this case study is to analyze
										biker data in order to find out how membership users and regular riders use the service. With this information, Bike Share can adjust their marketing
										strategy in order to encourage more users to join the Bike Share Membership. 
									</p>

										</div>
									</section>
									<p>In the end, I found that based on the times and days members would rent bikes, most of the members would be commuters that use bikes to get to work and school. 
										With this information I recommended a new marketing strategy that would advertise the Bike Share membership as a program for commuters that would save them money
										if they regularly rent bikes. This would encourage more membership sign ups as well as establish a guranteed group of bikers who will use the service reliably.

									<h2>BellaBeat Case Study</h2>
									<h5>August 2023</h5>
									<p>BellaBeat is a fitness app company that offers multiple devices in order to help users with their fitness journey. In addition to the app that 
										holds nutritional and fitness information of the user, BellaBeat also offers watches and bracelets that track activity levels, sleep patterns
										and stress. BellaBeat wants to analyze how customers use non-BellaBeat devices and use these trends in order to improve their own products
										and get more users.

												<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/BellaBeat_activity_levels_2.png" alt="" /></span></div>
												
											</div>
										</div>
									</section>
									<p>From analyzing how users use fitness devices I was able to make insights based on how active users are, their calories losses, steps and sleep patterns. 
										Overall, I suggested BellaBeat focus their devices in order to lower the amount of time users are in the sedentary state as much as possible. Additionally,
										I offered the idea that BellaBeat could add a sleep assistance fuction that will help users sleep at proper times.
